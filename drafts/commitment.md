The first step in any [ad]venture is prolonged commitment. Taking a daydream and turning it into action. Not an individual action a long gestation that bears fruits only when the time is right. School, money, other obligations, all obstacles for this somewhat selfish pursuit in the past. Incremental kicks in the side of life shifting its trajectory ever so slightly in the desired direction. This year the time has come. Good health, a favorable work situation, the equipment needed, my beloved (Saabaru)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Impreza_(second_generation)#Saab_9-2X], and a partner in adventure. I even have enough savings to last me through the season living off salami and tomatoes. The Goldilocks Zone, or at least as close as it's going to get.

Signed the lease and check on the ski condo, sight unseen. With the screeching sound of a closing mailbox, this daydream just clawed it's way into reality.
