# One Hundred Days

Like the endevour itself, the technology behind the site is also a step into the unknown( at least unknown to me) and the return to a perhaps simpler time. As a teenager, I became interested in software development through storytelling. This project is a return to that foundation: creation driven by curiosity and the desire to document. While this could be accomplished through the use of other more readily available tools, I believe those tools constrain the story itself. Plus it's all for fun anyway.

## Principles
### Storytelling above all else
### Attention to detail over automation
### Exploration of the medium


### The Tech
* [Rendr](https://github.com/airbnb/rendr)
* <del>[Superscrollorama](johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/)</del>
* [jQuery-panelsnap](https://github.com/guidobouman/jquery-panelsnap) SUPER Hacked up
* [jquery.videoBG](https://github.com/sydlawrence/jquery.videoBG)


### Unanswered technical questions

__Will displaying upwards of 100 different glimpses crash people's browsers?__

__Individual linking, is it needed?__

(Super amorphous thoughts around using pushstate and rendr/maybe infinity.js to make this fast)

### TODO
Deactivate State, reverse timeline and fade.
